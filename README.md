NOTE:
=====

Since the entire implementation of ePaper interface has changed - This can no longer be used!

I am writing an Android version for the new interface. iOS will come out if / when I get time.

Times of India - ePaper
=======================

This is an iOS application targetted for iPads only.

This application allows you to read the Times of India news paper in printed form.

You can use this application only from India as the ePaper is available for free only in India.

When you start the application, you are presented with a list of editions. You can select one edition and it will present today's news paper.

You can tap on one of the thumbnails to see list of articles on that page.

Tap an atricle to see the article. The application downloads the content locally so once you have read an article, it is available to view again without having to download it again.

On the edition page, you can tap the settings icon to see how much data is downloaded for a given day and you can swipe right-to-left to delete the data.
